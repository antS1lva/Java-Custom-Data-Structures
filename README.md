# Data Structures Project

## Overview

This repository contains custom implementations of various fundamental data structures, developed as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. The code was entirely handcrafted to deepen understanding of core concepts and algorithms, without reliance on external libraries or frameworks.

## Folder Structure

Inside the source folder you will find following directories:

- **exceptions**: Custom exceptions designed for use in the data structures.
- **graphs**: Implementations of graph-related data structures and algorithms.
- **heaps**: Custom heap structures, including min-heaps and max-heaps.
- **lists**: Various types of lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and array lists.
- **nodes**: Classes for nodes used in linked structures like lists and trees.
- **queues**: Queue implementations, including simple, circular, and priority queues.
- **stacks**: Stack implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **trees**: Custom tree structures, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.

## Development Environment

This project was developed using **IntelliJ IDEA**, a powerful and modern IDE for Java development. All code adheres to clean coding principles and has been thoroughly tested to ensure functionality.

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to:

1. Gain in-depth knowledge of data structure implementation.
2. Understand the inner workings of common data structures.
3. Prepare for practical use of data structures in solving complex problems.
